===============

Running fileOut.py will generate a random .in file that contains the genetic material for a sequence of notes. fileIn.py will use that file as input and create the .mid file, which then can be listened to. The crossover.py module will open two parent DNA files, determine a crossover point, combine the files around that point, and write the new offspring to its own DNA file. If the resulting organism is not of the same length as the parents, a mutation/correction function will randomly modify chromosomes until the offspring fits the length specification.
